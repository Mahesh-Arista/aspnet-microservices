        The <span class="badge badge-success">Recommendation microservice</span>
        simulates a recommendation service by implementing <i>naive</i> recommendations
        based on previously completed shopping carts.
        It persists its data primarily on a MySQL container and communicates
        to the other microservices primarily via asynchronous messages exchanges
        via a RabbitMQ container.
