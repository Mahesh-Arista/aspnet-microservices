        The <span class="badge badge-success">Shipping microservice</span>
        simulates a shipping service and is reached via a RabbitMQ queue
        and MassTransit. The service is triggered by the order workflow
        whenever shopping carts are approved from the fake
        <span class="badge badge-success">Payment microservice</span>.
        The service persists its data primarily on a MySQL container and communicates
        to the other microservices primarily via asynchronous messages exchanges
        via a RabbitMQ container.
