    <p>
        The catalog is provided by the
        <span class="badge badge-success">Catalog microservice</span>
        which consists of an ASP.NET Core app pulling data from a
        MongoDB container. The catalog is initialized with the
        <code>docker-compose</code> script. To change the catalog
        information, check th <code>db.js</code> file on the 
        <code>CatalogSvc</code> project.
        The catalog information is cached locally
        from the Web microservice on a Redis container.
