        The project also provides recommendations automatically built based on orders 
        built via asynchronous messages exchanged via a RabbitMQ Docker container 
        and processed by a .NET Core backend.
        The <span class="badge badge-success">Recommendation microservice</span>
        also offers an endpoint to query recommendations by product
        that responds to requests on product pages.
